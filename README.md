# Neural Network - K-means 

The purpose of this project is to implement and test a configurable neural network and k-means algorithm.

## Data Generation 

For the creation of the datasets, the generate_dataset.c file has been created. Executing it, creates the training_set.txt and test_set.txt for the training and testing of the neural network and dataset2.txt for the k-means algorithm of the second exercise. 

The datasets that where used for each task are generated by the script `generate_dataset.c`. Executing it creates `training_set.txt` and `test_set.txt` for the training and testing of the neural network and `dataset2.txt` for the k-means algorithm.

### Example

```bash
$gcc generate_dataset.c utility.c -lm
$./a.out 
```
